# Learning CSS
This repository contains the code that I did when learning HTML from [Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4R2E7O-Ngo).

**I learnt about** -
  - **CSS Selectors** - `id` and `class`
  - CSS color, font, background
  - **Various CSS units** - px, rem, vw, vh
  - **CSS Box Model** - borders, margins, padding, outlines, heights, widths, radius, box sizing: border box
  - **Typography** - `inherit` property for form/buttons/ etc. elements - Styling text and inheriting styles for consistent appearance in form elements.
  - **Link Styling** - text & cursor properties, pseudo classes - visited, hover, focus, active - Crafting styles for hyperlinks, including hover effects and pseudo-classes.
  - **List Styling** - list-style properties, pseudo element - Customizing lists with different styles, starting points, and using pseudo-elements for additional flair.
  - **CSS positioning** - relative, absolute, fixed - Placing elements in the document flow using different position values for precise layout.
  - **Flex Box** - A powerful layout model for building responsive and flexible design structures with ease.
  - **CSS Grid** -  Creating two-dimensional layouts, offering more control over rows and columns compared to Flexbox.
  - **CSS Variables** - Declaring reusable values to maintain consistency and ease of updating across a project, and it's use in creating dark and light mode.
  - **CSS Animations** - Bringing elements to life with keyframes and animation properties, adding dynamism to web pages.
